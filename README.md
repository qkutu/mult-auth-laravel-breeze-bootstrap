## About Project

It's the multi authentication login system based on breeze. Laravel Breeze normally uses tailwind CSS but most of the user still using bootstrap, so we change the breeze into bootstrap 4 version. In this project User and Admin has there different dashboard, they login from the same place but get redirected to different dashboard according to user type. Everything already structured in folders, just colne the repository and start developing from here.
